# This is the Meteor install script!
#
# Are you looking at this in your web browser, and would like to install Meteor?

# We wrap this whole script in a function, so that we won't execute
# until the entire script is downloaded.
# That's good because it prevents our output overlapping with curl's.
# It also means that we can't run a partially downloaded script.
# We don't indent because it would be really confusing with the heredocs.

# METEOR_RELEASE must be configured from environnements variables.

    # This always does a clean install of the latest version of Meteor into your
    # ~/.meteor, replacing whatever is already there. (~/.meteor is only a cache of
    # packages and package metadata; no personal persistent data is stored there.)

    # Now, on to the actual installer!

    ## NOTE sh NOT bash. This script should be POSIX sh only, since we don't
    ## know what shell the user has. Debian uses 'dash' for 'sh', for
    ## example.

Congrats ! Our bootstrap scripts worked on your docker build.

README.md will help on docker usage.
